# Job Application Tracker

Overview

We have created a Job Application Tracker app which is a productivity tool designed to help job seekers organize, monitor, and manage their job search in one central place. Instead of relying on spreadsheets, emails, or memory, the app provides a structured system to track applications from initial submission through interviews and final outcomes.

## Description

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the app is to simplify and streamline the job search process by:

Centralizing information – Store job details such as company name, position, and date applied.

Tracking progress – Monitor each application’s stage (applied, interviewing, offer, rejected, on-hold).

Improving organization – Reduce missed deadlines, forgotten follow-ups, and duplicated applications.

Supporting decision-making – Allows a user to visually compare job roles.

Reducing stress – Provide clarity and control during an often overwhelming job search.

### Intended Users
