# Job Application Tracker 

Overview

We have created a  Job Application Tracker app which is a productivity tool designed to help job seekers organize, monitor, and manage their job search in one central place. Instead of relying on spreadsheets, emails, or memory, the app provides a structured system to track applications from initial submission through interviews and final outcomes.


## Description

Purpose

The primary purpose of the app is to simplify and streamline the job search process by:

Centralizing information – Store job details such as company name, role, application date, status, contacts, and links in one location.

Tracking progress – Monitor each application’s stage (applied, interview, offer, rejected, follow-up needed).

Improving organization – Reduce missed deadlines, forgotten follow-ups, and duplicated applications.

Supporting decision-making – Compare roles, companies, and offers more easily.

Reducing stress – Provide clarity and control during an often overwhelming job search.

Intended Users

Students and recent graduates

Active job seekers
